# Understanding TypeScript

TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.

## Why Use TypeScript?

TypeScript offers static type definitions, which help catch errors early during development. This leads to more robust and maintainable code.

### Key Features of TypeScript

- **Static Typing**: TypeScript’s type system allows you to define the types of variables, function parameters, and return values.
- **Interfaces**: Define contracts within your code using interfaces, enabling a form of documentation and validation for the structure of your data.
- **Tooling**: TypeScript’s type inference and IntelliSense provide autocompletion, navigation, and code refactoring tools that greatly enhance the development experience.

## Conclusion

TypeScript adds a layer of safety and predictability to JavaScript, making it a powerful tool for large-scale applications.
